# FFgan
<i>A cutting-edge program that leverages the power of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate synthetic faces.</i>

<h1>Description</h1>
<p>FFgan is an innovative program that harnesses the power of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate synthetic faces. GANs consist of two neural networks, a generator, and a discriminator, engaged in a competitive learning process. The generator network learns to produce realistic synthetic faces, while the discriminator network learns to distinguish between real and synthetic faces.</p>

<p>By leveraging the advanced capabilities of the Dlib library for image processing and incorporating a specific DCGAN model for color image generation, FFgan offers a powerful and versatile platform for face generation. It enables users to create lifelike synthetic faces with exceptional realism and diversity.</p>

<p>This technology has significant implications for both research and model production. In research, FFgan provides a valuable tool for studying facial characteristics, exploring variations in facial expressions, and analyzing demographic trends without relying on real-world data. It offers researchers the ability to generate large datasets with controlled variables for training and evaluating facial recognition systems, expression analysis algorithms, and more.</p>

<p>FFgan opens up new possibilities for designing and iterating on novel face models. It allows designers and developers to experiment with different facial features, expressions, and attributes, accelerating the development of innovative applications in various fields, including computer graphics, entertainment, virtual reality, and character design.</p>

<p>An additional advantage of FFgan is its contribution to the protection of personal data. As the generation process relies solely on synthetic data, there is no need to use real faces or store large-scale personal datasets. This mitigates privacy concerns and reduces the risk of data breaches, making it a privacy-friendly solution for face-related research and applications.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>GAN-based face generation.</li>
  <li>Integration of Dlib library for image processing and IA model (also the Boost library).</li>
  <li>DCGAN for color image generation of medium resolution (up to 162 pixels).</li>
  <li>Built-in internal web server for convenient model testing.</li>
  <li>Ready to use without extensive setup (pre-computed model provided).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>To install FFgan and recompile the program, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Ensure that you have the latest version of Dlib (version 19.24) installed.</li>
  <li>Make sure you have a compatible platform, such as Windows 10, and the Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 (64-bit, Version 17.6.0) compiler.</li>
  <li>Download the FFgan source code from the GitHub repository.</li>
  <li>Open the project in Microsoft Visual Studio.</li>
  <li>Recompile the project using the provided source files.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: The provided synchronization file also allows you to recreate the model from scratch if needed.</p>

<p>The training process for FFgan involved utilizing a dataset of over 250,000 faces extracted from real photos captured from the internet. A dedicated crawler was created specifically for this purpose. The face extraction and alignment process used traditional techniques, including those demonstrated in the examples of the Dlib library.</p>

<p>FFgan designed from the example "dnn_dcgan_train_ex.cpp" (available at <a href="http://dlib.net/dnn_dcgan_train_ex.cpp.html">http://dlib.net/dnn_dcgan_train_ex.cpp.html</a>). The CNN model has been adapted for generating high-quality color images.</p>
